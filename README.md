# Full Stack Project
This full stack project is designed for me to showcase my skills in moderns web technologies as well as expand my skillset in modern web deployment. The front-end of this system is based in React.JS and consumes an API created using Go. Both the front-end and back-end technologies are containerized and hosted on Digital Ocean.

### Golang API
This repository contains the back end API for this project. This API is created using Golang and containerized using Docker/Kubernetes. This API currently supports comment creation, deletion as well as editing.
